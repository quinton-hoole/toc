# CNCF Special Interest Groups ("SIGs")

The CNCF TOC Special Interest Groups scale contributions by the CNCF
technical and user community, while retaining integrity and increasing quality
in support of our [mission](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/charter.md#1-mission-of-the-cloud-native-computing-foundation).

The TOC and CNCF Staff will draft an initial set of charters for the [proposed
SIGs], and solicit/elect suitable chairs.

## Process

A TOC member who volunteers or is nominated to be a SIG co-chair will hold
at least one open meeting with active TOC Contributors and invite related
groups within the CNCF community, recruit two additional chairs and draft
a charter ([example charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18ufx6TjPavfZubwrpyMwz6KkU-YA_aHaHmBBQkplnr0/edit?usp=sharing), then submit
a pull request with the proposed charter, updating the list
of current SIGs below.
