## Initial SIGS

To bootstrap the process, the TOC proposes the following SIGs, and projects assigned to each SIG. Clearly all of these SIG’s will not be fully-formed overnight or begin operating immediately, so the TOC itself will fulfill the duties of not-yet-formed SIG’s until they are.  We can however, fairly immediately, assign one voting member of the TOC as liason for each SIG, and prioritize the order of formation of the SIGs, starting immediately with the most pressing ones.
